# Casting

We are a small group of aspiring filmmakers looking to up our game and create films that we can submit to film festivals.  You can view some of our work [here](https://www.youtube.com/@useless.poodle).

## Volunteers Only

Participation gets your name out there on FilmFreeway.com.  The filmmakers are not being paid either.

## General audition instructions

Please exactly follow the "How to audition" directions for the given role.  Upload video auditions to YouTube with [unlisted visibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177), and e-mail a link to your video, along with any other requested material, to  **casting.frill392@passinbox.com**.  Please use "audition" as the e-mail subject, and explicitly state in your message which role interests you.  You are welcome to audition for more than one role.

For all video auditions, your cellular phone camera and built-in microphone are good enough.  Don't spend a bunch of time on lighting.  We need to assess your acting ability; not your ability as a videographer.  Please ensure your camera is stationary and that you are in focus.

Age ranges, when specified, are for the character; not the actor.  You should be able believably to play a person in the given age range.

If you seem like a good candidate, you will receive a response via e-mail or as a comment on your YouTube video.  If we like your audition but don't select you for a role, we will let you know and contact you directly when we have another part for which you might be a match.

## NOW CASTING - Doomer & Scabs: All and Nothing

![Doomer & Scabs: All and Nothing](/images/dns_aan.jpg)

This short, filmed in Raleigh, NC, primarily features 2 young men having a philosphical conversation while fishing.  The other role is for a young woman in a brief cutaway scene.  Production mostly is complete, but we still need to film the scene with Lacy (see below).

### Lacy (woman 18-25)

Lacy is a thrift store employee with whom one of the male protagnists is infatuated.  This is a bit part for which you just need to smile and say, "Hi."  We will film Lacy's scene indoors at a mutually convenient time.

#### How to audition

Please send us a link to a recent, public (not behind a login) image of yourself wearing something appropriate for a woman working behind a cash register, and also tell us about any acting experience you have.  Alternatively, record a brief video to introduce yourself.

We're hoping to meet somebody ready to go in the future, when we have a more prominent female role to offer.
