# Casting

We want to cast 2 people in Raleigh, NC for a short film.  Pre-production mostly is complete, and we desire to move to principal photography (a.k.a. filming the thing!) as soon as we have actors who know their lines.

If you're interested, please exactly follow the "How to audition" directions for the given role, and e-mail the requested material to casting.frill392@passinbox.com.  If you seem like a good candidate, you will receive a response from a protonmail.com e-mail address.

## Volunteers Only

We are a small group of aspiring filmmakers looking to up our game and create films that we can submit to film festivals, which gets your name out there on filmfreeway.com if you participate.  Neither the writer, nor the director, nor anybody else is getting paid.  If you are reliable and work well with us, we are happy to pay you for future collaborations when that becomes feasible.  If we like your audition but don't select you for a role, we will contact you directly in the future when we have another part for which you might be a match.

## Role 1: Man 21-27

This role is for a male character having a philosophical conversation while fishing.  Shooting will be at Lake Johnson around sunrise, so please only respond if you can be available that early in the morning.  You will have about 5 minutes of dialogue to memorize and rehearse.

### How to audition

If you're interested, please dress in whatever you would wear to go fishing in the early morning of an Autumn day, and record yourself from the waist up while sitting and reciting one or both of the following pieces of dialogue.  The words need to sound natural.  You're just chilling with your friend by the lake.

The camera on your phone is adequate.  Please upload your video to YouTube with [unlisted visibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177), and e-mail us a link to the video.  Sites other than YouTube are okay, but we must be able to view your video without having to login.

Please also tell us about any relevant acting experience you have.  For example, did you participate in drama in high school?  Have you acted in community theater or a television commercial?

**1st dialogue option:** Yeah, my dad told me about the magic. A long time ago, somebody figured out that if you made this specific shape out of specific materials, and if you got going at a certain speed, then magically, the world would let you fly.  I think the magic part is like unseen forces let us do the actual act of flight, but you still need all the other stuff too.

**2nd dialogue option:** I'm already tired, and I still got a whole lifetime left to go.  All I've got is some pretty ragtag scraps of willpower and the sort of complacent curiosity just strong enough to make me wonder what will happen in whatever moment comes next... and sunrises are cool too.

## Role 2: Woman 18-25

This is a bit part.  You just need to smile and say "hi" to another person.  We will film this character's scene indoors at any mutually convenient time.

### How to audition

Please send us a link to a recent, public (not behind a login) image of yourself, and also tell us about any acting experience you have.  We're hoping to meet somebody ready to go in the future, when we have a more prominent role to offer.
