# Casting

We are a small group of aspiring filmmakers looking to up our game and create films that we can submit to film festivals.  You can view some of our work [here](https://www.youtube.com/@useless.poodle).

## Volunteers Only

Neither the writer, nor the director, nor anybody else is getting paid yet.  Participation gets your name out there on FilmFreeway.com.

## General audition instructions

Please exactly follow the "How to audition" directions for the given role.  Upload video auditions to YouTube with [unlisted visibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177), and e-mail a link to your video, along with any other requested material, to  **casting.frill392@passinbox.com**.  Please use "audition" as the e-mail subject, and explicitly state in your message which role interests you.  You are welcome to audition for more than one role.

For all video auditions, your cellular phone camera and built-in microphone are good enough.  Don't spend a bunch of time on lighting.  We need to assess your acting ability; not your ability as a videographer.  Please ensure your camera is stationary and that you are in focus.

Age ranges, when specified, are for the character; not the actor.  You should be able believably to play a person in the given age range.

If you seem like a good candidate, you will receive a response via e-mail or as a comment on your YouTube video.  If we like your audition but don't select you for a role, we will let you know and contact you directly when we have another part for which you might be a match.

## Doomer & Scabs: All and Nothing

![Doomer & Scabs: All and Nothing](/images/dns_aan.jpg)

**We are no longer casting for this production.**

~~We want to cast 3 people in the vicinity of Raleigh, NC.~~  This short primarily features 2 young men having a philosphical conversation while fishing.  The other role is for a young woman in a brief cutaway scene.  Pre-production mostly is complete, and we desire to move to principal photography as soon as we have actors who know their lines.

Shooting the scene for the male characters will be at Lake Johnson around sunrise, so **please only audition for those roles if you can be available that early in the morning.**  The male characters have about 10 minutes of dialogue total to memorize and rehearse.  The word count is evenly divided between them.

When auditioning for either male role, please dress in whatever you would wear to go fishing in the early morning of an Autumn day, and record yourself from the waist up while sitting and reciting the prescribed dialogue.  The words and cadence need to sound natural.  You're just chilling with your friend by the lake.  It's okay to make small modifications if the exact words don't roll off your tongue.

**For all roles, please also tell us about any relevant acting experience you have.**  For example, did you participate in drama in high school?  Have you acted in community theater or a television commercial?  We welcome you to send us links to your past work.

### Role 1: Doomer (man 21-27)

**This part has been cast.**

Doomer is a firm non-believer in most things, which guides him in his cynical nature. He is a despairing artist who is never satisfied. At his core, he has quite a lot of empathy and love for the world and its people (Scabs included), despite knowing that they are all doomed eventually.

#### ~~How to audition~~

~~Please recite this dialogue on video:~~

> ~~I'm already tired, and I still got a whole lifetime left to go.  All I've got is some pretty ragtag scraps of willpower and the sort of complacent curiosity just strong enough to make me wonder what will happen in whatever moment comes next . . . .  And sunrises are cool too.~~

### Role 2: Scabs (man 20-26)

**This part has been cast.**

Scabs is firm believer in magic, which is in all things and moves through all things. He has some misguided optimism--the feeling that he knows the truth about everything.  At his core, he is a pretty alright dude who cares about others deeply.  He believes that the magic/universe will work everything out for good and that he doesn't really have to worry too much.

#### ~~How to audition~~

~~Please recite this dialogue on video:~~

> ~~Yeah, my dad told me about the magic. A long time ago, somebody figured out that if you made this specific shape out of specific materials, and if you got going at a certain speed, then magically, the world would let you fly.  I think the magic part is like unseen forces let us do the actual act of flight, but you still need all the other stuff too.~~

### Role 3: Lacy (woman 18-25)

**This part has been cast.**

Lacy is a thrift store employee with whom Scabs is infatuated.  This is a bit part for which you just need to smile and say, "Hi."  We will film Lacy's scene indoors at a mutually convenient time.

#### ~~How to audition~~

~~Please send us a link to a recent, public (not behind a login) image of yourself wearing something appropriate for a woman working behind a cash register, and also tell us about any acting experience you have.  Alternatively, record a brief video to introduce yourself.~~

~~We're hoping to meet somebody ready to go in the future, when we have a more prominent female role to offer.~~
